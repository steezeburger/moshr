# TODOs

- create justfile for commonly used project commands, like build, test, run,
  etc.
- put built binary in a `bin/` directory and add this to gitignore
- it would be nice if the avi conversion process had more accurate progress
  reporting
  - it feels like it freezes because the loader bar only loads to X% and stays
    there. maybe ui that shows it's checking the status and that it's still
    converting?
