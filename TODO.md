# TODOs

- need the ability to stitch together moshes
- would be awesome to be able to add masks to the video
- when batch generating, it shows incorrect ui. e.g. it shows 3 moshes, then 2,
  then 1, but it should be just showing 3. the rendering loop logic is broken.
- must refresh after mp4 generation to show the green button
- must refresh after session delete to remove the session from the list
- detect scenes function doesn't work
- not sure what show keyframes feature does
